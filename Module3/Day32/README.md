# Day 32: Excel Manipulations
**Instructions:** 
1. Open a new python file.
2. The most widely used tool in analytics and business is actually Excel, so it's extremely common to automate regular reports. These four examples are common use cases for automating Excel tasks using python. While Excel is a powerful tool that accomplishes most business needs, there are two major issues: a lack of transparency and a lack of version control. Often, business reports are created in Excel and contain embedded formulas to transform the data. However, while the cell contains the formula, the user only sees the output. This causes problems if the developer didn't password protect the cells and the formula is overwritten or changed at a later date. Since there is no version control functionality, the business may not even know this change occurred and decisions could be made on incorrect information. Pro tip, do not price financial market funds using an Excel spreadsheet, especially when the formulas are not protected. Python provides the ability to harden the transformation process to protect the business from these types of mistakes. [Practical Business Python](https://www.pbpython.com/) is a phenomenal resource for converting existing Excel reports into hardened python processes.
