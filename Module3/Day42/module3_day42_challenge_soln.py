    Description:    One of the best uses of python automation is web scraping. This opens the door for immense
                    possibilities to simplify your life. One of the most stressful periods of anyone's life is buying a
                    house. There are aggregation sites like Zillow and Realtor, but it's time consuming to review the
                    sites for hours to find your dream abode. Wouldn't it be easier if python did it for you?
                        1. Create a python program to scrape at least one realtor site.
                        2. The program should accept a list of search criterion.
                        3. The program should pull at least the address, cost, tax information, and any photos.
                        4. The results should be written to a file and an email should be sent to confirm the number of
                           houses identified.
                        5. This should be able to able to distinguish between a new house and a house already captured
                           by the program. Only add the new houses to the file.
