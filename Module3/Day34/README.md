# Day 34: PowerPoint Manipulations
**Instructions:** 
1. Open a new python file.
2. Just as Excel is the most common data tool in business, PowerPoint is the most common tool for presentations. Through the use of several packages, python can automate data collection and presentation creation.
3. The [python-pptx](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package can be used to interact with PowerPoint presentations. When a presentation is read, a presentation object is created.
    ```
    from pptx import Presentation

    pres = "TheDoctor.pptx"
    doctors = Presentation(pres)
    print(f"doctors: {doctors}")
    ```
4. The presentation object contains the `.slides` method. Each slide in the presentation is a slide object which can be called to pull information contained in the PowerPoint deck.
    ```
    for i, slide in enumerate(doctors.slides):
        print(f"{i}: {slide}")
    ```
5. The slide contains specific identifiers and names based on the format of the slide. Additionally, the elements in the slide are in an OpenXML format.
    ```
    title_slide, content_slide = doctors.slides[0], doctors.slides[1]
    print(f"Slide ID: {title_slide.slide_id}\nSlide Element: {title_slide.element}\nSlide Layout: "
          f"{title_slide.slide_layout.name}")
    print(f"Slide ID: {content_slide.slide_id}\nSlide Element: {content_slide.element}\nSlide Layout: "
          f"{content_slide.slide_layout.name}")
    ```
6. Within each slide, there are objects that are used to contain content.
    ```
    for i, slide in enumerate(doctors.slides, start=1):
        print(f"Slide {i}, Type: {slide.slide_layout.name}")
        for shape in slide.shapes:
            print(f"Shape Type: {shape.placeholder_format.idx}\tPlaceholder Name: {shape.name}")
    ```
7. The text within the placeholder can then be extracted and stored as a dictionary with the tile of the slide as the key and the values of the Content Placeholder as the key/value pairs in the nested dictionary. The resulting dictionary resembles a JSON file that contains the data from all of the relevant slides.
    ```
    doctor = dict()
    for i, slide in enumerate(doctors.slides, start=1):
        if slide.slide_layout.name == "Two Content":
            title = slide.shapes.title.text
            deets_dict = dict()
            for shape in slide.shapes:
                if shape.placeholder_format.idx == 1:
                    details = shape.text.split("\n")
                    for item in details:
                        deets_dict[item.split(": ")[0]] = item.split(": ")[1]
                    doctor[title] = deets_dict
        else:
            continue

    print(doctor)
    ```
8. The `python-pptx` package can also create presentations. There are functions for adding shapes, images, and formatting the presentation for a consistent output. As a simple example, the dictionary created by reading the initial deck can be used to automatically create a new deck. Just with other automation tasks, the initial development takes time to effectively create the desired output. This package can be used to automate report generation based off data in an Excel spreadsheet. While this package is still in beta, it is already powerful enough to automate many of these clerical tasks.
    ```
    from datetime import datetime

    # A blank presentation object is created.
    new_pres = Presentation()

    # The title slide is added which includes a creation date in the subtitle.
    slide = new_pres.slides.add_slide(new_pres.slide_layouts[0])
    slide.shapes.title.text = "This was created with python".title()
    slide.placeholders[1].text = f"Created on {datetime.date(datetime.now())}".title()

    # The contents of the dictionary are iterated over to create a new slide for each new doctor. 
    for i, title in enumerate(doctor):
        new_slide = new_pres.slides.add_slide(new_pres.slide_layouts[3])
        shapes = new_slide.shapes
        title_shape = shapes.title
        title_shape.text = title
        # The details of the Doctor are added to the left placeholder. The actor is added first and then the remaining
        # details are iterated over to add as a new paragraph.
        body_shape = shapes.placeholders[1]
        tf = body_shape.text_frame
        tf.text = f"{list(doctor[title].keys())[0]}: {doctor[title][list(doctor[title].keys())[0]]}"
        for j in range(1, len(doctor[title])):
            tf.add_paragraph().text = f"{list(doctor[title].keys())[j]}: {doctor[title][list(doctor[title].keys())[j]]}"

    # After the content is added, the presentation is saved.
    new_pres.save('auto_pres.pptx')
    ```
