# Anytime a program takes charge of the computer, it's critical that the user has a way to terminate the program. The
# `pyautogui` package has a `.PAUSE` variable that can be set with the number of seconds the program will wait after
# performing its action. Additionally, there is the `.FAILSAFE` variable that controls the option to force quit the
# program by moving the mouse to the upper-left corner of the screen.

# After launching the Word file to be converted to a PDF, focus needs to be applied to the application. The application
# first sends an `f12` command to try and open the `Save As` dialog box. If `pyautogui` locates the file type field by
# using an image of the option and the `.locateOnScreen` function, then the program continues. Otherwise, it locates the
# Microsoft Word icon on the taskbar and clicks on it. Once the focus is confirmed, the program selects the file type
# field and types `p d f` and then presses enter. Then, the program locates and clicks on the `Save` button. Since the
# `.locateOnScreen()` function returns more information than required for the `.click()` function, the `.center()`
# function is used to only return the `left` and `top` values.
