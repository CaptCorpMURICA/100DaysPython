# Module 3: Automation with Python
This module begins the path of applying python in a practical manner. Subsequent lessons are less about the foundational principles of the language and more about how it can be applied in various facets of life. This module contains 14 different uses of automation with python. Before beginning any automation project, you first need to understand the benefit gained from completing the application. Will the automation improve the overall accuracy of the process? Will the automation reduce resource waste by eliminating the need to complete repetitive tasks? Do you want to automate it just because it's boring and you have better things to do with your time? As part of answering these questions, you also need to understand the overall benefit (time, money, and sanity) of the application. If the benefits outweigh the cost of development, then it's time to start coding.
