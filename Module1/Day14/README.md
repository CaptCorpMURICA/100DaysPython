# Day 14: Module 1 Challenge
**Instructions:** 
1. Open a new python file.
2. Create a program that iterates through a list of values. If the object is immutable, print the type and advance to the next step. If the object is mutable and a string, add "Allegedly" to the end. If the object is mutable and a number, take 10 (int) to 20 (float) percent off, print the new value, and overwrite the value in the existing position. If an object is not a string, number, or tuple, end the program immediately while displaying the object and the type for review.
3. `content = ["Wayne is the toughest guy in Letterkenny.", list(range(0,101,10)), ("Wayne", "Dan", "Katy", "Daryl"), 10.4]`
4. Update the [log file](../../log.md) with what you have learned today.
