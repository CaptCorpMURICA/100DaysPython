    Description:    Create a program that records a collection of meals for a school cafeteria menu as well as the
                    ingredients.
                      i. This collection, of at least 5 meals, cannot be modified, but the ingredients for the meal can.
                     ii. Add another five meals to the collection.
                    iii. Print five results while skipping every other meal.
                     iv. You realize you made a mistake with one of the meals and forgot the most important ingredient.
                         Update the meal to add creme fraiche.
                      v. You realize that all of these meals need a little creme fraiche. Use a loop to update all of
                         these meals at once. Make sure you don't accidentally add too much creme fraiche. Each meal
                         should only have it once in the ingredients list.
                     vi. Finally, modify the program so each meal is printed with the name of the meal at the highest
                         hierarchy and each ingredient is printed on its own line underneath the name of the meal. The
                         ingredients should be indented to provide a natural understanding of which ingredients belong
                         to which meal.
