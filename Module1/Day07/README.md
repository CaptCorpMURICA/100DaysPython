# Day 7: Ranges
**Instructions:** 
1. Open a new python file.
2. A range starts with an index of 0 and ends with the declared value. The endpoint of a range in not inclusive. Therefore, the range will contain indices from 0 to 41, but it will not use 42. _Type and execute:_  
   `print(range(42))`
2. Update the [log file](../../log.md) with what you have learned today.
