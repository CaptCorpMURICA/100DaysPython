## Day 1: Installing Python
**Instructions:**
1. _Install the python interpreter:_ Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python applicable to your system and install it on your machine.
2. _Download the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. Here are a couple of options:_
    * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is a good choice to start. It is a distribution system that comes packaged with tools like Jupyter Notebook and Spyder. This option has limitations for advanced techniques and production implementation, but it would be more than sufficient for this 100 Days of Code.
    * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) is an excellent IDE with substantial functionality. The professional version is free if you are a student, but the community edition is more than sufficient. This IDE contains native Git integration, built in documentation, an excellent debugger, and even support for Jupyter Notebooks. It is my preferred IDE, but it is a more advanced tool.
    * [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is a fairly recent player in the IDE space. It has been receiving high praise from the development community, but it does require more of a learning curve.
3. _Become familiar with your chosen IDE:_ Open your chosen IDE and follow the included documentation to become familar with the environment.
    * [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
    * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/documentation/)
    * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
4. _Hello World:_ The _Hello World_ exercise is just to validate that everything is installed and working properly.
    1. Open the IDE you just installed and follow the instructions applicable to that choice to create a new python script file.
    2. Type `print("Hello World!)` in the script window.
    3. Execute the script
    4. Congratulations. You just ran your first python program.
5. Update the log file with what you have learned today.
