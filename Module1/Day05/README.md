# Day 5:  String Formatting
**Instructions:** 
1. Open a new python file.
2. Python contains built in methods to modify strings. _Type and execute:_  
   `cheers = "where everybody knows YOUR name."`  
   `cheers.capitalize() # Applies proper casing to the string.`  
   `cheers.title() # Applies proper casing for use in titles.`  
   `cheers.lower() # Converts the entire string into lowercase.`  
   `cheers.upper() # Converts the entire string into uppercase.`  
   `cheers.swapcase() # Inverts the casing on the string. If it was lowercase, it would be turned uppercase and vice versa.`  
   `"norm".upper() # These methods do not have to be applied only to variables. They can also be applied directly to strings or other objects.`
