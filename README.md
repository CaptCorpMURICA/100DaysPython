# 100 Days of Python
This exercise is based off the [100 Days of Code framework](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

**Under Development**

## Why 100 Days of Code?
You first need to ask yourself why you want to learn python. Are you looking for a career change or to strengthen your current prospects? Is it because [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm) has ranked Data Scientist as the best job in America since 2016? Along that line, what avenue of programming are you interested? In order to succeed at completing this program, you first need to understand why you want to do it.

Python is an excellent language for software development, web development, automation, data engineering, data analytics, data science, and more. The 100 Days of Code framework is meant to instill a new habit while simultaneously accomplishing your goal. According to a study published in the [_European Journal of Social Psychology_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674), it takes 66 days on average to start a new habbit. The technical fields change extremely rapidly; therefore, it is critical to form the habit of continual learning if you wish to succeed as a programmer. Good luck on your learning journey.

## Rules
1. The exercise is segmented in to seven modules that each span 2 weeks. You should expect to spend _One Hour_ each day on average.
2. At the conclusion of each day, modify the [log file](../master/log.md) with the topic, completion date, and what you learned.
3. Upload any created during the day's exercise with the format: _moduleX\_dayX\_topic.py_ for python scripts or _moduleX\_dayX\_topic.ipynb_ for Jupyter Notebook files
4. Get into the practice of commenting your code to explain the expected output or function.

## Resources
### Datasets

## Add:
1. ~~Instructions on how to do 100 Days of Python~~
2. Table of Contents for each module. The README file in the appropriate module folder will contain the daily tasks and instructions for those two weeks.
3. ~~Log file to be updated at the end of each session. This should include what was done and what was learned.~~
4. ~~Resources page that contains information about excellent free options to assist in the process.~~
5. ???
