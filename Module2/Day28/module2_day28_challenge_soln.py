    Description:    Create a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using a substitution cipher. The user provides a
                    word that does not have any duplicate letters and no numbers or special characters. The user then
                    provides the instruction to either encrypt or decrypt the message. Finally, the user then provides
                    the message to be encrypted or decrypted. Create a function to check if the transposition word is
                    valid, another function to encrypt the message, and a third function to decrypt the message. When
                    encrypting the message, only letters should be provided; do not return any spaces, numbers, or
                    special character. Additionally, the program should not be case sensitive and all output should be
                    in lowercase. A substitution cipher is created by shifting the letters of the alphabet based on a
                    keyword. For instance, if the word provided is "zebra", the cipher would be:
                    {"a": "z",
                     "b": "e",
                     "c": "b",
                     "d": "r",
                     "e": "a",
                     "f": "c",
                     "g": "d",
                     etc.}
